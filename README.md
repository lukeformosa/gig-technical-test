# GiG Technical Test
 
## Initial Steps

- I first analysed the problem and identified a possible solution.
- I then researched for the ideal packages to use to create the RESTful API along with a connection to the DB (PSQL).
- Started off by generating a template Maven project using [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/).
- From this project, I spent a few hours getting to grips with Java and understanding how the Spring framework interacts with the PSQL db and handles API calls.
- From this point onwards, I felt confident in implementing the required business logic to create the solution required
